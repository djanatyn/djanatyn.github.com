<p>Heyo!</p>
<p>I've been doing a lot of coding recently, and I've learned a lot in the process. A lot of the time, I've found cool and interesting stuff that I've shared with people, and I wanted to have a way to share things with everyone at once. I want this development blog to be a platform for that - a way to keep people updated on what I'm working on, and a nice place to share information.</p>
<p>The whole site is actually using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>, a nice ruby application for building static websites. It's really freeform in the design of your site, but also does a lot of the work for you, like organizing entries. I've had trouble blogging in the past, but I've got a pretty good workflow set up. I write my entries on my local computer, use git to keep everything up to date, and push things to github once I'm done. The "source code" for the site is freely available, at <a href="http://github.com/djanatyn/djanatyn.github.com">its github page</a>. That has all of the templates and the posts that I'm hosting on the site.</p>
<p>One of the cool things about jekyll is that it has pygments integrated in, which lets me easily embed code with syntax highlighting. I'm a huge fan of syntax highlighting, and colorful things, so maybe that could encourage me to blog about things I write as well. Here's an example:</p>
<p>{% highlight perl %}
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
use warnings;

print "Hello world!";
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>Anyway, this has been a lot of fun to set up, and I want to do some fun things with it. Until then, thanks for reading!</p>
